# Comparative-Analysis-of-Continuous-and-Discrete-Datasets

Continuous Dataset:

Predicted the Global Sales(Units) of Video game sales using Python, Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-learn packages.
Analyzed the performance of 8 Machine learning Regression models and found the best combination of preprocessing techniques, machine learning model and hyper-parameters to achieve highest accuracy.

Discrete Dataset:

Built a classification tool which predicted whether the pulsar candidates are a Pulsar Star using various preprocessing techniques and machine learning models, achieving 97% prediction accuracy. Analyzed the performance of 8 Machine learning Classification models and found the best combination of preprocessing techniques, machine learning model and hyper-parameters to achieve highest accuracy.
